# CCMS - Campus Complaint Management System (Frontend)

This is a React (JavaScript) + Tailwind CSS frontend skeleton for a Campus Complaint Management System.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Setup Tailwind:
   ```
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
   (The project already contains a tailwind config and postcss config.)

3. Run the dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only skeleton with mock navigation and sample data. Hook it to a backend API by replacing mock actions with axios calls.
- Suggested additions: authentication (JWT), protected routes, form validation (react-hook-form + yup), toasts, and persistent state.
